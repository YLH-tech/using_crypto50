  "faq00": "Forgot the funds password processing method for platform transactions",
  "faq01": "If you forget the trading fund password on the platform, please go to 'My-Settings-Click Set Fund Password' or contact customer service to reset.",
  "faq10": "What is the value of the stop loss and profit setting in opening a position? How should it be set?",
  "faq11": "Take profit and stop loss are the upper limit of profit and loss set by you. When the set amount of stop profit and stop loss is reached, the system will automatically close the position. It can be used for risk control when you buy a contract. Half of the set profit-taking amount is: amount of increased quantity x leverage multiple, set stop loss. We recommend that you set it according to your actual asset situation and reasonably control the risk.",
  "faq20": "How to reduce contract risk?",
  "faq21": "You can transfer the available assets of the remaining accounts to the contract account by transferring funds, or reduce the risk by reducing the open positions.",
  "faq30": "What does the quantity in the contract opening mean?",
  "faq31": "The quantity in the open position represents the number of currencies you expect to buy. For example: select on the opening page of the BTC/USDT trading pair, buy long, enter the price as 1000USDT, and enter the amount as 10BTC, it means: you expect to buy 10 BTC with a unit price of 1000USDT.",
  "faq40": "How is the handling fee in the contract calculated?",
  "faq41": "Handling fee = opening price * opening quantity * handling fee rate",
  "faq50": "Notes on forced liquidation",
  "faq51": "Risk is a measure of the risk of your assets. When the risk is equal to 100%, your position is regarded as a liquidation, and the risk = (position margin / contract account equity) * 100%.",
  "faq60": "What are the contract trading rules?",
  "faq61": "Transaction type\n\nTrading types are divided into two directions: long positions (buy) and short positions (sell):\n\nBuy long (bullish) means that you think that the current index is likely to rise, and you want to buy a certain number of contracts at the price you set or the current market price.\n\nSell short (bearish) means that you think that the current index is likely to fall, and you want to sell a certain number of new contracts at a price you set or the current market price.\n\nOrdering method:\n\nLimited price order: you need to specify the price and quantity of the order placed.\n\nMarket order: you only need to set the order quantity, and the price is the current market price.\n\nWhen the order you submit for opening a position is completed, it is called a position.\n\nContract delivery issues:\n\nThe platform contract is a perpetual contract with no set delivery time. As long as the system does not meet the conditions for liquidation or you do not manually close the position, you can hold the position permanently.\n\nSystem liquidation:\n\n1. The system will automatically close the position if the set value of Take Profit and Stop Loss is reached.\n\n2. The risk is too high, and the system is forced to close the position.",
  "faq70": "What are limit order and market order?",
  "faq71": "The limit order refers to the price you expect to entrust the platform to trade, and the market order refers to the direct entrustment of the platform to trade at the current price. In the rules for opening a position, market orders take precedence over limit orders.\n\nIf you choose a limit order, please open a position reasonably based on the current currency market price to avoid losses due to unreasonable opening prices.",
  "faq80": "What does the risk level of contract transactions represent?",
  "faq81": "Risk degree is a risk indicator in your contract account. A risk degree equal to 100% is considered as a liquidation. We suggest that when your risk exceeds 50%, you need to open your position carefully to avoid losses due to liquidation. You can reduce your risk by replenishing the available funds of contract assets, or reducing your positions.",
  "faq90": "Why is currency exchange necessary?",
  "faq91": "The purpose of the exchange is to allow the smooth circulation of funds in different currencies in your assets, and the QcC obtained in the futures account can be freely converted into USDT for trading. USDT in other accounts can also be freely converted to QcC for trading.",
  "faq100": "How to buy USDT through the platform?",
  "faq101": "Method 1: Select the order you want to buy through the platform buy and sell list to buy and sell.\n\nMethod 2: Click the publish button to publish a buy or sell order for quick transactions according to your needs.\n\nThe system will quickly match you with buying and selling users. Note: If the purchase order is not paid after 15 minutes, the system will automatically cancel the order, please pay in time. If the order is canceled more than 3 times on the same day, the transaction cannot be performed again on the same day, and the trading authority will be restored the next day.",
  "faq110": "Why does the converted amount of assets change?",
  "faq111": "The equivalent calculation in the asset is the value of the current holding digital currency converted into USDT, which changes due to the price fluctuation of the digital asset. The number of your digital assets has not changed.",
